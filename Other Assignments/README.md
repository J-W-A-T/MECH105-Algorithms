This contains some other interesting algorithms I have created in Mech105

**Day Tracker**
-This algorithm uses a set of all the days within the months(One with a leap year and one without)
and takes in a user input to display the number of days through the year that day falls.

---

**Normal to Binary**
-This algorithm takes in a normal base 10 number and convertis it to a binary base 2 number.
