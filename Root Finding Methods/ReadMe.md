This Folder contains all of the root finding methods that I made in Mech105.

---

**False Position**
-This algorithm takes in a function and a left and right guess. Using these guesses my code runs through the 
false position method.

---

**Newton Raphson**
-This algorithm takes an initial guess, function and calculates the function's derivative to run it through
the newton raphson method to find the root.
