This Folder contains all of the Numerical Methods that I made in Mech105.

**Simpsons One Third Rule**
-This algorithm takes in a set of data(two matrices) and uses the One Third rule to estimate the integral. 
This code takes into account a lot of errors and even incorporates the trapazoidal rule.

---

**LU Decomposition**
-This algorithm takes in a matrix and it's outputs and runs them through guess elimination and seperates into
LU decomposition components. This code runs through multiple errors to make sure it runs correctly.
